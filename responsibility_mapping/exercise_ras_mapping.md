# Exercise: RAS mapping

##Situation

* An international bank is losing market share due to slow investment decisions
* Too many people are involved in signing off actions. It wants to simplify accountability and reduce cost and time to act

##Complication

* Regulatory pressure requires the bank to prove its compliance with anti-money laundering and multiple other regulations
* The bankâ€™s board requires any changes to reduce workload but still be compliant

##Tasks
Review current responsibilities linked from Roles to Processes :
* Show any activities over-loaded with decision makers and approvers
* Show any processes not covered properly
* Show where >3 departments are involved in approving
* Identify opportunities to reduce numbers of decision makers

**Note:** Datasets to use: 11.1 Investment Roles, 11.2 Investment Processes, 11.3 Links
