# Cloning Exercise: Re-organising sales department

##Using the Cloning method you can compare different scenarios side by side 

####Sophisticated overview of the scenarios in org hierarchy:

####Measure the impact from multiple angles:

![](3A-004.cloningmeasureimpact.png)

###Situation

* 
After a decline in sales, the board has appointed a new Sales Director

* 
The new Director has asked for a review of the 5 sales teams, each of which consists of 1 manager and 5-10 team members

###Complication

* 
Some incumbent sales managers are not performing in line with their grade

* 
The sales teams have become unbalanced in terms of cost, despite their sales geographies having similar potential

###Tasks

* 
Propose a simple re-organisation of the sales department, with two agreed design principles :

  * 
Top performing managers should be retained in team leader positions

  * 
Each team should have broadly similar overall cost

* 
The resulting To-Be organisation should then be compared with the As-Is, showing impact in cost and spans of control, overall and at each level

**Note:** Datasets to use: 9.1 Sales Department


##How-to summary

###Create a Clone

![](3A-005.createaclone.png)

1. In Tree view, drag the root node onto             to clone the whole organisation

2. Create a property named Scenario

3. The original set of nodes inherit As-Is and the cloned set of nodes inherit To-Be

###Model the Scenario

![](3A-006.modelscenario.png)

1. Filter out new scenario using Filter Control

2. Color by performance ranking

3. Assign top performance to team leaders

4. Scale the card based on roll-up cost 

5.Drag-and-drop the nodes to optimise number and size of teams


###Visualise the Impact

![](3A-007.visualiseimpact.png)

1. Compare organisational structure of the two in Tree view

2. Chart the differences, such as outgoing count split by depth, overall cost, average performance ranking etc.

###Get exercise data into OrgVue 

1. Open the Excel workbook for OrgVue Advaned Training

2. Find a data sheet for this chapter:
  * 9.1 Sales Department 

3. In OrgVue, create a dataset named ‘Sales Department – [your name]’ in the People tab using ‘9.1  Sales Department’ data sheet
