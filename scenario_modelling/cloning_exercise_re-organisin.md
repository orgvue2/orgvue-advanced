###Situation

* 
After a decline in sales, the board has appointed a new Sales Director

* 
The new Director has asked for a review of the 5 sales teams, each of which consists of 1 manager and 5-10 team members

###Complication

* 
Some incumbent sales managers are not performing in line with their grade

* 
The sales teams have become unbalanced in terms of cost, despite their sales geographies having similar potential

###Tasks

* 
Propose a simple re-organisation of the sales department, with two agreed design principles :

  * 
Top performing managers should be retained in team leader positions

  * 
Each team should have broadly similar overall cost

* 
The resulting To-Be organisation should then be compared with the As-Is, showing impact in cost and spans of control, overall and at each level
