# Branching Exercise: Re-organisation by planning group

###Situation
* An organisation with 1,505 employees in 13 departments across 13 locations
* Planning to classify departments into planning groups and take necessary actions for operational efficiency

###Complication
* The impact of changes need to be measured quickly from multiple angles

###Tasks
* Model the To-Be organisation and capture impact of changes using Branching method
* Assign each of the departments to one of 6 planning groups and determine suitable actions for each area of business
  * Planning Groups: Back Office, Distribution, P&P, R&D, Sales and Executive
  * Actions: outsourced, redundant, relocate, reassigned, new, unchanged

3. In the branched dataset, create required new properties, e.g. planning group, action

2. Assign each department to a planning group using **‘Paint with Data’**
3. Review each planning group and determine suitable actions – **‘Paint with Data’**


###Visualise the Impact

1. View the areas affected by changes using various visualisations in **Tree view**
2. Use **Changes Report  Dashboard** to see the differences against the baseline (original scenario)
