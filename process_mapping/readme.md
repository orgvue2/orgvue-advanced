# Process mapping (Links - numbers)

##Situation

* The Marketing department has 12 people with £702K total payroll cost

* The CMO is looking for more efficient marketing processes, eliminating or simplifying steps, and achieving cost savings

##Complication

* Interviews show lack of clarity on who is doing what and how much time and cost each activity currently takes
* Unions are asking which areas and how many people will be affected by change

##Tasks

* Identify actual % time spent and cost for each activity, plan actions to increase efficiency, and see the cost and FTE impacts:
  *  Map resources (time spent) against each activity (Links)
  * View process dashboard and activity cost (Dashboard, Scaled card)
  * Determine appropriate actions for each activity (Look up)
  * Measure the impacts by process, role and area (Chart, Dashboard)

**Note:** Datasets to use: 12.1 Marketing Roles, 12.2 Marketing Processes, 12.3 Links

##How-to Summary Part 1: Mapping and Analysing Current Activities

**Set up Datasets and Links**

![](5A-001.setupdatasets.png)

1. Set up a Roles dataset and a Process dataset 
2. **Link** Roles dataset to Process dataset through % time spend (activity data)

**Show what people can do**

![](5A-002.showpeople.png)
1. See how people’s time is allocated between activities in **Org chart**
2. See how the work is done from **Process dashboard**

**Calculate and analyse Activity Cost

![](5A-003.calculateactivitycost.png)
1. Calculate **cost of each activity** based on actual FTEs involved and payroll cost
2. See which activities use most resources using **Chart**
3. See activity cost in activity tree **roll-up Scaled card**
