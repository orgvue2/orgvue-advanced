# Account administration

##Navigate to Users Tab

Admin can administer all user accounts through the Users Tab on the Home Screen.

**There should only be one dataset storing a list of accounts and roles within the Users dataset. Please do not 'Save as' a second dataset - this creates duplicate users.**

##Open the Users Dataset
In the users dataset you can see a list of all of the accounts that have access to this Tenant

##Add a new account

Add a New Account through the ‘Add Node’ option on the Property Pane.
