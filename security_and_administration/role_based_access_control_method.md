# Role Based Access Control method

##Overview

Users need to be given permissions to access datasets which they do not own. Using RBAC method, tenant Admins can administer user access to a dataset or a property; setting up user permission groups and tagging datasets/ properties.

## At Dataset level

Using RBAC method, the dataset owner or Admin can set the level of Users' access to a dataset. The following steps will control user access at dataset level:

1. Define custom permission groups and assignment rules, e.g HRBP, Finance, IT, Manager
2. Assign an individual user to a permission group(s)
    * Open the Users data tab in the Users tab
    * Select the user whose access level you wish to alter and modify a User's role to put it into extra permission groups

3. Set a permission group's access level to a dataset using Tags
    * Select a dataset from the Home Screen and click on ‘Tags..’ icon at the top-right
    * Using ‘Apply tag’ dialogue, set appropriate access levels for a permission group
    * Tags are displayed along with dataset name and date modified

**Note: You can Tag a dataset to be Viewed or Edited by multiple permission groups**
